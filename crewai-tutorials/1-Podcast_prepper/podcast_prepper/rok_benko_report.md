- Total Cost: $0.025059

## Total Cost

Total Estimated Cost: $0.121734 ($0.096675 + $0.025059)

## Code Used for Calculations

```python
# Define token costs
INPUT_TOKEN_COST = 3 / 1000000  # $3 per million input tokens
OUTPUT_TOKEN_COST = 15 / 1000000  # $15 per million output tokens

# Guest Research Crew data
guest_input_tokens = 14410
guest_output_tokens = 3563
guest_successful_requests = 4

# Questions Research Crew data
questions_input_tokens = 3908
questions_output_tokens = 889
questions_successful_requests = 1

# Calculate costs for Guest Research Crew
guest_input_cost = guest_input_tokens * INPUT_TOKEN_COST
guest_output_cost = guest_output_tokens * OUTPUT_TOKEN_COST
guest_total_cost = guest_input_cost + guest_output_cost

# Calculate costs for Questions Research Crew
questions_input_cost = questions_input_tokens * INPUT_TOKEN_COST
questions_output_cost = questions_output_tokens * OUTPUT_TOKEN_COST
questions_total_cost = questions_input_cost + questions_output_cost

# Calculate total cost
total_cost = guest_total_cost + questions_total_cost

# Print results
print(f"Guest Research Crew Cost: ${guest_total_cost:.6f}")
print(f"  Input Cost: ${guest_input_cost:.6f}")
print(f"  Output Cost: ${guest_output_cost:.6f}")
print(f"Questions Research Crew Cost: ${questions_total_cost:.6f}")
print(f"  Input Cost: ${questions_input_cost:.6f}")
print(f"  Output Cost: ${questions_output_cost:.6f}")
print(f"Total Estimated Cost: ${total_cost:.6f}")
```

Note: The reported costs are estimates due to the consumption of tokens by the Cost Calculation crew and Exa tool, which are not accounted for in the usage data. The actual cost may be slightly higher than the estimated amount presented here.
