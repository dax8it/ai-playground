## Guest Research Crew Cost

The Guest Research Crew usage details are as follows:
- Input Tokens: 15,927
- Output Tokens: 2,948
- Successful Requests: 4

Calculated cost:
- Input Token Cost: $0.0478 (15,927 * $3 / 1,000,000)
- Output Token Cost: $0.0442 (2,948 * $15 / 1,000,000)
- Total Guest Research Crew Cost: $0.0920

## Questions Research Crew Cost

The Questions Research Crew usage details are as follows:
- Input Tokens: 2,852
- Output Tokens: 938
- Successful Requests: 1

Calculated cost:
- Input Token Cost: $0.0086 (2,852 * $3 / 1,000,000)
- Output Token Cost: $0.0141 (938 * $15 / 1,000,000)
- Total Questions Research Crew Cost: $0.0227

## Total Cost

The total cost for both crews is calculated as follows:
- Guest Research Crew Cost: $0.0920
- Questions Research Crew Cost: $0.0227
- Total Cost: $0.1147

## Code Used for Calculations

```python
# Constants
INPUT_TOKEN_COST = 3 / 1_000_000  # $3 per 1 million input tokens
OUTPUT_TOKEN_COST = 15 / 1_000_000  # $15 per 1 million output tokens

# Guest Research Crew
guest_input_tokens = 15927
guest_output_tokens = 2948
guest_successful_requests = 4

# Questions Research Crew
questions_input_tokens = 2852
questions_output_tokens = 938
questions_successful_requests = 1

# Calculate costs
def calculate_cost(input_tokens, output_tokens):
    input_cost = input_tokens * INPUT_TOKEN_COST
    output_cost = output_tokens * OUTPUT_TOKEN_COST
    return input_cost + output_cost

guest_cost = calculate_cost(guest_input_tokens, guest_output_tokens)
questions_cost = calculate_cost(questions_input_tokens, questions_output_tokens)
total_cost = guest_cost + questions_cost

# Print results
print(f"Guest Research Crew Cost: ${guest_cost:.4f}")
print(f"Questions Research Crew Cost: ${questions_cost:.4f}")
print(f"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.4f}")
print(f"Guest Research Crew Successful Requests: {guest_successful_requests}")
print(f"Questions Research Crew Successful Requests: {questions_successful_requests}")
```

*Note: The calculated cost is an estimate because the Cost Calculation crew also uses some tokens that are not reflected in the initial calculation shown above. These costs are excluded because the exact number of tokens used by this crew is only available after execution (i.e., when you're reading this). However, the token usage is expected to be approximately $0.03. To get the complete total, you can manually calculate and add the Cost Calculation crew's cost to the Total Cost calculated by CrewAI. See the from the `log_token_usage.txt` file.*"
