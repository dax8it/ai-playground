Of Rok Benko, whose spirit is bold.
A lecture in high school, just two hours long,
Sparked a curiosity, fierce and strong.

HTML, CSS, not quite a sight,
But Rok's journey began with all his might.
Every day after school, he'd code and learn,
His future in tech, a flame that burned.

A Master's in economics, but tech was his call,
400 applications, he stood tall through them all.
Job hunting for twelve months, no luck in sight,
He said, "I'll be a solopreneur, shine my own light!"

AI apps in public, no experience, no fear,
'Code AI with Rok,' a YouTube channel clear.
Stack Overflow's #1 OpenAI contributor, he's known,
His expertise in AI, widely sown.

GitHub, LinkedIn, X, and more,
His presence online is never a bore.
'ai-playground,' tutorials galore,
Rok's impact on tech, it's hard to ignore.

From rejections to success, his story's a charm,
He's carved his own path, away from harm.
So here's to Rok Benko, a tech star so bright,
Whose journey inspires, with all its light!
