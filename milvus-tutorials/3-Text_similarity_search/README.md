## üìñ Description üìñ

Python example on how to do text similarity search with Milvus (_Note: input vector is calculated with spaCy_).

<br>

## üß† Learning goals üß†

- **Setting up Milvus Standalone for text similarity search:** We will learn how to set up Milvus Standalone for text similarity search by:

    - Running Milvus Standalone Docker containers composed in the [previous](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/tree/main/milvus-tutorials/1-Milvus_standalone_starter) tutorial
    - Understanding the *Movies* collection and its structure created in the [previous](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/tree/main/milvus-tutorials/2-Attu_starter) tutorial

- **Performing text similarity search:** We will explore the process of conducting text similarity searches with Milvus Standalone, covering:

    - Generating embedding vectors with spaCy: Utilizing spaCy to convert user queries into embedding vectors suitable for similarity search.
    - Executing similarity searches: Configuring Milvus Standalone to perform similarity searches on the *Movies* collection.
    - Interpreting search results: Analyzing the distances returned by Milvus Standalone to find the most relevant items from the *Movies* collection to the user query.
